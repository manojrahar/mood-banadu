# Mood Banadu

Mood Banadu is a mood-based AI recommendation web app that suggests **recipes, music, and movies** based on how you’re feeling.

Instead of random suggestions, Mood Banadu understands your **mood** and curates a complete experience — what to cook, what to listen to, and what to watch.
